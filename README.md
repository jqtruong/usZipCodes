In Groovy, 
- use a public API to retrieve and store postal code information for all fifty US states
- generate a tag cloud of state names based on the number of postal codes per state
- sort the state names in ascending alphabetical order
- and provide a method for clearing the data and starting over

Bonus points for tests and use of GitHub (or BitBucket).
